        <p>Annie in Black is built on contrasts - fragile whispers against walls of sound, haunting melodies wrapped in
          raw intensity. Our music is less about escape and more about confrontation: confronting silence, grief, loss,
          and the shadows that follow us.</p>
        <p>
          Each song begins with lived experience - sleepless nights, memories of friends gone too soon, the weight of
          unspoken thoughts. From there it takes shape in atmospheric guitars, layered textures, and vocals that shift
          between vulnerable and fierce. The result is music that feels both intimate and immense, pulling the listener
          into a world where sorrow, regret, and fractured hope live side by side.
